Description: A variant of subsampling where subsamples are drawn as complementary
    pairs have favorable properties in the context of stability selection such
    as relaxing the strong exchangability assumption Shah and Samworth (2013)
    <doi: 10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.01034.x>. The 'crtb' package implements
    complementary resampling of tags in block, an experimental method designed
    as an analog to complementary pairs subsampling which can be used in the
    context of resampling. The crtb() function can be used to implement the
    method while the crtb_lm_sim() function streamlines simulation studies
    comparing standard resampling to the method implemented in crtb().
