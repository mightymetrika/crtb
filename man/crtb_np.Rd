\title{Complementary Resampling of Tags in Blocks (Non-Pooled Version)}
\usage{
crtb_np(
  dat,
  tie_thresh = 0.5,
  replace = TRUE,
  sample_fun = NULL,
  grp_var = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame containing the data to resample. Each column represents
a group or variable.}

\item{tie_thresh}{Numeric; a threshold between 0 and 1 to decide if there are
too many ties in the resampled data. If the proportion of unique resampled
tags is less than \code{tie_thresh}, the function will return \code{NULL}
for that group and issue a warning. Default is \code{0.5}.}

\item{replace}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), resampling is done with
replacement.}

\item{sample_fun}{A user-defined function for custom sampling. This function
should accept a vector of tags (the data to be resampled) and return a
resampled vector of the same length. If \code{NULL} (default), the standard
\code{sample} function is used with the \code{replace} argument.}

\item{grp_var}{Character; name of the column that contains group labels when data is in long format
(i.e., one observation per row with a separate column for group membership). If \code{NULL}
(default), assumes data is in wide format with groups as separate columns. The function will
perform separate resampling for each unique group in this column.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
\item{crdat}{The complementary resampled data.}
\item{ordat}{The original resampled data.}
}
\description{
Performs complementary resampling of tags in blocks (crtb) on the provided data
without pooling the groups. This function applies the resampling procedure
separately to each group (column) in the data, which can be useful when groups
are independent or should not be combined.
}
\details{
The function applies the complementary resampling method implemented in
\code{\link{crtb_p}} to each group separately, without pooling the data. This
is useful in contexts where the groups are independent or when pooling the data
may not be appropriate.
