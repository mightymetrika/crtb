\title{Complementary Resampling of Tags in Blocks (Non-Pooled Version)}
\usage{
crtb_np(dat, tie_thresh = 0.5, replace = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame containing the data to resample. Each column represents
a group or variable.}

\item{tie_thresh}{Numeric; a threshold between 0 and 1 to decide if there are
too many ties in the resampled data. If the proportion of unique resampled tags
is less than \code{tie_thresh}, the function will return \code{NULL} for that
group and issue a warning. Default is \code{0.5}.}

\item{replace}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), resampling is done with replacement.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the resampled data, matching the structure of
the input \code{dat}. Each column is the result of applying \code{crtb_p} to
the corresponding column in \code{dat}.
}
\description{
Performs complementary resampling of tags in blocks on the provided data
without pooling the groups. This function applies the resampling procedure
separately to each group (column) in the data, which can be useful when groups
are independent or should not be combined.
}
\details{
The function applies the complementary resampling method implemented in
\code{\link{crtb_p}} to each group separately, without pooling the data. This
is useful in contexts where the groups are independent or when pooling the data
may not be appropriate.
}
\note{
If any group results in too many ties (based on \code{tie_thresh}), the
function will return \code{NULL} for that group, and a warning will be issued.
