\title{Complementary Resampling of Tags in Blocks (Pooled Version)}
\usage{
crtb_p(dat, rowwise = TRUE, tie_thresh = 0.5, replace = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A dataframe or vector containing the data to resample. If a
dataframe, each column represents a group or variable.}

\item{rowwise}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), tagging is done row-wise
across groups. If \code{FALSE}, tagging is done column-wise within each group.}

\item{tie_thresh}{Numeric; a threshold between 0 and 1 to decide if there are
too many ties in the resampled data. If the proportion of unique resampled tags
is less than \code{tie_thresh}, the function will return \code{NULL} and issue
a warning. Default is \code{0.5}.}

\item{replace}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), resampling is done with
replacement.}
}
\value{
A data frame or vector containing the resampled data, matching the
structure of the input \code{dat}. If \code{dat} is a data frame, the output
will be a data frame with the same column names.
}
\description{
Performs complementary resampling of tags in blocks on the provided dataset,
pooling all groups together.
}
\details{
The function operates by assigning unique tags to each observation in the data.
It then resamples these tags (with or without replacement) and rearranges the
data into blocks and their complements. This approach ensures that each observation
is either included in a block or its complement, which may enhance the performance
of resampling-based methods.

If the proportion of unique resampled tags is below the \code{tie_thresh}, the
function considers there to be too many ties (duplicate tags) and returns
\code{NULL} with a warning. This is to prevent unreliable results due to
insufficient variability in the resampled data.
}
\note{
The method is particularly useful in situations where the standard bootstrap
may not be appropriate due to dependencies within the data
or the need for improved stability in variable selection procedures.
